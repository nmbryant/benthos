Resource is an output type that runs a resource output by its name. This output
allows you to run the same configured output resource in multiple places.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  resource: ""
```

Resource outputs also have the advantage of name based metrics and logging. For
example, the config:

```yaml
output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
    - kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topic: foo
    - gcp_pubsub:
        project: bar
        topic: baz
```

Is equivalent to:

``` yaml
output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
    - resource: foo
    - resource: bar

resources:
  outputs:
    foo:
      kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topic: foo

    bar:
      gcp_pubsub:
        project: bar
        topic: baz
 ```

But now the metrics path of Kafka output will be
`resources.outputs.foo`, this way of flattening observability
labels becomes more useful as configs get larger and more nested.
