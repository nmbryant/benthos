## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance.
Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more
[in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `url`

The URL of the target MongoDB DB.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"mongodb://localhost:27017"`  

```yaml
# Examples

url: mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### `database`

The name of the target MongoDB DB.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `collection`

The name of the target collection in the MongoDB DB.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `username`

The username to connect to the database.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `password`

The password to connect to the database.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `operation`

The mongo operation to perform. Must be one of the following: insert-one, delete-one, delete-many, replace-one, update-one.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"update-one"`  

### `write_concern`

The write concern settings for the mongo connection.


Type: `object`  

### `write_concern.w`

W requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the specified number of mongodb instances.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `write_concern.j`

J requests acknowledgement from MongoDB that write operations are written to the journal.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `write_concern.w_timeout`

The write concern timeout.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `document_map`

A bloblang map representing the records in the mongo db.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `filter_map`

A bloblang map representing the filter for the mongo db command.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `hint_map`

A bloblang map representing the hint for the mongo db command.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`  

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching).


Type: `object`  

```yaml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yaml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

processors:
  - merge_json: {}
```

### `max_retries`

The maximum number of retries before giving up on the request. If set to zero there is no discrete limit.


Type: `number`  
Default: `3`  

### `backoff`

Control time intervals between retry attempts.


Type: `object`  

### `backoff.initial_interval`

The initial period to wait between retry attempts.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"1s"`  

### `backoff.max_interval`

The maximum period to wait between retry attempts.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

### `backoff.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum period to wait before retry attempts are abandoned. If zero then no limit is used.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"30s"`
