Resource is a processor type that runs a processor resource by its name. This
processor allows you to run the same configured processor resource in multiple
places.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
resource: ""
```

Resource processors also have the advantage of name based metrics and logging.
For example, the config:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
        root.message = this
        root.meta.link_count = this.links.length()
        root.user.age = this.user.age.number()
```

Is equivalent to:

``` yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - resource: foo_proc

resources:
  processors:
    foo_proc:
      bloblang: |
        root.message = this
        root.meta.link_count = this.links.length()
        root.user.age = this.user.age.number()
```

But now the metrics path of the Bloblang processor will be
`resources.processors.foo_proc`, this way of flattening observability
labels becomes more useful as configs get larger and more nested.
