Prints a log event each time it processes a batch. Messages always remain
unchanged. The log message can be set using function interpolations described
[here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries) which allows you to log the
contents and metadata of messages.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
log:
  level: INFO
  fields: {}
  message: ""
```

In order to print a log message per message of a batch place it within a
[`for_each`](/docs/components/processors/for_each) processor.

For example, if we wished to create a debug log event for each message in a
pipeline in order to expose the JSON field `foo.bar` as well as the
metadata field `kafka_partition` we can achieve that with the
following config:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - for_each:
      - log:
          level: DEBUG
          message: 'field: ${! json("foo.bar") }, part: ${! meta("kafka_partition") }'
```

The `level` field determines the log level of the printed events and
can be any of the following values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.

### Structured Fields

It's also possible to output a map of structured fields, this only works when
the service log is set to output as JSON. The field values are function
interpolated, meaning it's possible to output structured fields containing
message contents and metadata, e.g.:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - log:
        level: DEBUG
        message: "foo"
        fields:
          id: '${! json("id") }'
          kafka_topic: '${! meta("kafka_topic") }'
```

## Fields

### `level`

The log level to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"INFO"`  
Options: `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`, `ALL`.

### `fields`

A map of fields to print along with the log message.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

### `message`

The message to print.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`
