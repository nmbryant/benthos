## Metadata
This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:
```
- sftp_file_path
```
You can access these metadata fields using [function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#metadata).

## Fields

### `address`

The address of the server to connect to that has the target files.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `credentials`

The credentials to use to log into the server.


Type: `object`  

### `credentials.username`

The username to connect to the SFTP server.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `credentials.password`

The password for the username to connect to the SFTP server.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `paths`

A list of paths to consume sequentially. Glob patterns are supported.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `max_connection_attempts`

How many times it will try to connect to the server before exiting with an error.


Type: `number`  
Default: `10`  

### `retry_sleep_duration`

How long it will sleep after failing to connect to the server before trying again, defaults to 5s if not provided.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

```yaml
# Examples

retry_sleep_duration: 10s

retry_sleep_duration: 5m
```

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of consumed files are converted into messages, codecs are useful for specifying how large files might be processed in small chunks rather than loading it all in memory. It's possible to consume lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"lines"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `auto` | EXPERIMENTAL: Attempts to derive a codec for each file based on information such as the extension. For example, a .tar.gz file would be consumed with the tar-gzip codec. Defaults to all-bytes. |
| `all-bytes` | Consume the entire file as a single binary message. |
| `csv` | Consume structured rows as comma separated values, the first row must be a header row. |
| `csv-gzip` | Consume structured rows as comma separated values from a gzip compressed file, the first row must be a header row. |
| `delim:x` | Consume the file in segments divided by a custom delimter. |
| `lines` | Consume the file in segments divided by linebreaks. |
| `tar` | Parse the file as a tar archive, and consume each file of the archive as a message. |
| `tar-gzip` | Parse the file as a gzip compressed tar archive, and consume each file of the archive as a message. |


```yaml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar
```

### `delete_on_finish`

Whether to delete files from the server once they are processed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `max_buffer`

The largest token size expected when consuming delimited files.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1000000`  

### `multipart`

Consume multipart messages from the codec by interpretting empty lines as the end of the message. Multipart messages are processed as a batch within Benthos. Not all codecs are appropriate for multipart messages.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
